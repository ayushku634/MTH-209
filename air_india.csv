Food is great, my favorite part in their food is they add a local touch like if you are travelling to Kolkata, you get some Kolkata items like rosogolla in the snack or dinner or lunch, same applies for other states.

After flying now several times the sector DEL-FRA I must say that the service has improved a lot.
The inflight entertainment could be better.
Excellent value for money.
Keep on the good work.
Thanks
"
1721,"The flight timings, service, food etc were good. Just the overall condition of the aircraft was below par. The armrests were wobbly, food tray was loose/broken . These things were ok for a no frills airline but not for a full fledged national carrier.

This obviously doesn't fill us with the most confidence as surely an announcement to the rest of the passengers...
"
1732,"Their business class service is ok. Food is average and seats not as comfortable. However, the 4pm landing in Mumbai works well to get rid of jet lag. The return from Mumbai is also at a decent hour and you don't have to stay up all night.

1757,"Terrible, utter nonsense, poor quality staff, no respect to passenger's time, silly excuses, sad faces, flight delays. It is terrible even as per the Indian standards.

1772,"Onboard service is very poor, for example if you required blanket they simply denied and said,'' blankets are for old persons and kids."" No airlines are doing like this. Important is that it is not happened first time.
It is a very early morning flight so they have to provide blankets.

Friendly crew, although the flight attendants are mostly old, they do a good job with the service and ready to give you extra drinks and meals.
