In arrival & departure columns there are 6 different timings: Night, Morning, Early_Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Late_Night
In class column there are 2 different classes: Economy, Business

2.2 Problems with the Dataset

The main problem with Dataset is that the data is two to three years old so the price prediction might not match the current scenario of prices of airline tickets.



3. Data collection and methods

3.1 Data source 

Data is being derived from Google search.

3.2 Variables Considered
The various features of the dataset are explained below:

- Airline: The name of the airline company is stored in the airline column. It is a categorical feature having 6 different airlines.

- Flight: Flight stores information regarding the plane's flight code. It is a categorical feature.

- Source City: City from which the flight takes off. It is a categorical feature having 6 unique cities.

- Departure Time: This is a derived categorical feature obtained created by grouping time periods into bins. It stores information about the departure time and have 6 unique time labels.

- Stops: A categorical feature with 3 distinct values that stores the number of stops between the source and destination cities.

- Arrival Time: This is a derived categorical feature created by grouping time intervals into bins. It has six distinct time labels and keeps information about the arrival time.

- Destination City: City where the flight will land. It is a categorical feature having 6 unique cities.

- Class: A categorical feature that contains information on seat class; it has two distinct values: Business and Economy.

- Duration: A continuous feature that displays the overall amount of time it takes to travel between cities in hours. 10)Days Left: This is a derived characteristic that is calculated by subtracting the trip date by the booking date.

- Price: Target variable stores information of the ticket price.


3.3 Data Preprocessing

For model fitting data is preprocessed using LabelEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing module.


- we have transform the'airline','source_city','destination_city','departure_time','arrival_time','stops','class' column of dataframe 'df'using 'fit_transform' method involving fitting a LabelEncoder on data and then transforming it

- We have dropped the column 'unnamed'
 from dataframe 'df'

- We have drop the coumn 'flight' from dataset which is of no use to us in modelling.



 4. Visualizing the dataset
 

4.1 Libraries used in the process
- matplotlib
- seaborn



4.2 Plots we have used
- bar graphs
- line graphs
- pie charts
- strip plot
- scatter plot

4.3 Plot of  Number of flights of Airlines in India.

we draw this plot using sns.countplot for 'airline' column.

![](1img.jpg)


- From the plot , we can see 'Vistara' has maximum no. of fights followed by 'Air India' while 'Spice Jet' has least no. of flights

4.4 Plot of Ticket Costs

The seaborn. stripplot() method is used to draw a scatter plot where one of variables passed as argument is a categorical variable.Here the categorical variable is "class of travel". From the above figure, we can see 'Economy' class tickets usually cost between 2500 - 22500 while 'Business' class tickets usually cost between 25000 - 95000

![](2img.jpg)

4.5 Plot of Duration of flights


This shows  the distribution of ticket price varying with duration of flight. More no. of green and brown points in the figure is explained by the fact that 'Vistara' and 'Air India' have maximum no. of flights. Clearly , Indigo has more no of short duration flights at comaparatively cheaper price.

![](3img.jpg)

4.6 Plot on Tickets booked before X days

This plot concludes  that ticket price rise slowly till 20 days from the date of flight, then rise sharply till the last day, while dramatically reducing just 1 day before the date of flight. This can be explained by the fact that people usually buy flight tickets within 2-3 weeks of flight which generates more profits for airlines. On last day, prices show dramatic reduction as airlines hope to fill the flight completely due to increase the load factor and decrease the operational cost per passenger.

![](4img.jpg)

4.7 Plot of Departure time and Arrival time

This plot concludes that flights departing late at night are cheapest while those arriving early morning and late night are cheap too. Flights departung in afternoon are relatively cheap as well.

![](5img.jpg)


4.8 Plot on Airline ticket price based on the source and destination cities.

 This plot shows that flight departing from Delhi are usually cheaper which can be explained by the fact that Delhi being capital has very strong connectivity with every other city and more no. of freqencies resulting in cheaper ticket prices. Chennai-Bangalore seems to be the most expensive route to fly while Hyderabad is most expensive city to fly.

### 

## Overview

1. The project delves into assessing customer sentiment towards SpiceJet by employing two distinct sentiment analysis models, namely Naive Bayes and SVC, leveraging the Bag of Words technique for feature extraction.

2. Notably, the Naive Bayes model emerges as the frontrunner, exhibiting enhanced efficacy in identifying positive reviews, as evidenced by its higher F1-score, thereby shedding light on the potential prowess of unsupervised learning paradigms.

3. Furthermore, to bolster the overall accuracy and comprehensiveness of the analysis, proposed enhancements encompass the adoption of advanced text cleaning methodologies, exploration of diverse feature extraction techniques, and meticulous error analysis, all of which are poised to yield deeper insights into customer satisfaction trends and nuances within the SpiceJet ecosystem.

## What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique aimed at determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. It involves analyzing text data to discern whether the expressed opinion is positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis algorithms typically classify text into these categories based on the presence of certain words, phrases, or linguistic patterns that convey sentiment. This analysis can be applied to various types of text data, such as customer reviews, social media posts, news articles, and more, to gauge public opinion, sentiment trends, and customer satisfaction levels.

## How sentiment analysis was applied to Indian airlines?

The objective of this project was to utilize sentiment analysis as a tool to comprehensively understand and analyze the sentiments expressed by customers towards Indian airlines, thereby providing valuable insights into customer satisfaction, sentiment trends, and potential areas for improvement.

## Scope of this Project

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of customer reviews collected from prominent airlines, including Go Air, Air India, Jet Airways, Indigo, and Spicejet. We consider a wide range of review attributes, including the content of the reviews, ratings, and other relevant factors. However, our analysis is limited to text-based reviews and does not cover other forms of feedback such as ratings or surveys.

## Significance of this Analysis

Understanding customer sentiments is essential for airlines to enhance passenger experiences, improve service quality, and make informed business decisions. By analyzing customer reviews and classifying sentiments, airlines can identify areas for improvement, address customer concerns, and ultimately increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. Our project aims to provide valuable insights and actionable recommendations for airlines to better serve their passengers and stay competitive in the industry.

## How was SVM used

Support Vector Machines (SVM) were employed as the machine learning model for sentiment classification of customer reviews in this project. SVM was chosen for the following reasons:

*1. Classification Task:* SVM is well-suited for classification tasks, making it ideal for categorizing customer reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

*2. High-Dimensional Data:* Customer reviews often contain a large number of features (words or tokens), and SVM can effectively handle high-dimensional data, making it suitable for sentiment analysis tasks.

*3. Non-linear Separability:* SVM can capture complex patterns and relationships in the data, including non-linear relationships between features (words or tokens), which is beneficial for sentiment analysis tasks where relationships may not be linear.

*4. Margin Maximization:* SVM maximizes the margin between the decision boundary and the closest data points, leading to better generalization performance and reduced overfitting, crucial for sentiment analysis tasks requiring robust models.

*5. Performance:* SVM is known for its high accuracy and robustness in classification tasks, making it a suitable choice for sentiment classification in this project.

## Use of Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes played a pivotal role in this project for sentiment classification of customer reviews. Here's why it was chosen:

*1. Text Classification Suitability:* Naive Bayes is well-suited for classifying customer reviews into sentiment categories (positive, negative, or neutral) due to its effectiveness in text classification tasks.

*2. Probabilistic Framework:* It operates within a probabilistic framework, estimating the probability of each sentiment class based on observed features (words or tokens) in the reviews, aligning seamlessly with the project's classification needs.

*3. Efficiency and Scalability:* Naive Bayes offers computational efficiency and scalability, making it suitable for handling large volumes of textual data, crucial for analyzing numerous customer reviews.

*4. Robustness to Feature Independence:* Despite assuming feature independence, Naive Bayes often performs well, even with noisy or irrelevant features in reviews, ensuring reliable sentiment classification.

*5. Baseline Model and Interpretability:* It serves as a reliable baseline model, establishing initial performance benchmarks. Its transparent nature allows stakeholders to understand sentiment classification decisions, fostering insight into review analysis.

In summary, Naive Bayes was strategically chosen for sentiment classification due to its alignment with project objectives, efficacy in text classification, computational efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. Leveraging Naive Bayes facilitated accurate sentiment classification, enabling insightful analysis of customer reviews.

## How is Linear Algebra and Probability applied here

Linear algebra and probability play essential roles in various aspects of the project, particularly in the implementation of machine learning algorithms and data analysis. Here's how they are applied:

1. *Linear Algebra*:

   - *Vectorization*: In natural language processing (NLP), text data is often represented as numerical vectors. Linear algebra concepts such as vectors and matrices are fundamental for representing and manipulating these numerical representations efficiently.
   
   - *Feature Representation*: Techniques like CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer, which convert text data into numerical feature vectors, rely on linear algebra operations such as dot products and matrix multiplications. These operations are used to transform raw text data into high-dimensional feature spaces suitable for machine learning algorithms.
   
   - *Support Vector Machines (SVM)*: SVM is inherently a linear algebra-based algorithm. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the feature space. The optimization problem involved in training an SVM model often requires linear algebra techniques such as matrix inversion, dot products, and solving systems of linear equations.

2. *Probability*:

   - *Naive Bayes Classifier*: The Naive Bayes classifier is based on Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. The classifier assumes that features are conditionally independent given the class label, allowing it to compute class probabilities efficiently.
   
   - *Sentiment Analysis*: Sentiment analysis tasks involve predicting the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of text data based on probabilistic models. Probability distributions, likelihood estimation, and Bayesian inference techniques are utilized to compute the likelihood of different sentiment labels given the observed data.
   
   - *Model Evaluation*: Probability plays a crucial role in evaluating machine learning models. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed based on the probabilities predicted by the models. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation involve probabilistic sampling and averaging to estimate the model's generalization performance.

Overall, linear algebra and probability form the theoretical foundations of many machine learning algorithms and techniques used in the project. They are essential for understanding, implementing, and evaluating these algorithms, ultimately contributing to the success of the sentiment analysis task and the extraction of insights from customer reviews.
